# VORTUP: Instrumentation software for slo-oct device at EyePod

This application will control the SLO-OCT device at UCDavis EyePod lab. More generally, I hope it will control a device similar to this one. the main limitation is hardware, specifically the acquisition and IO cards used. This software will work with acquisition cards from Alazar, and IO cards from National Instruments (NI-DAQmx cards).
